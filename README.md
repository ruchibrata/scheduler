## Setup

## Start

Running `npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or `webpack` separately, you can also
`npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.

From there, just follow your bliss.

## Deployment

Ready to go world wide? Here's a guide to deployment! There are two
supported ways to deploy in Boilermaker:

* automatically, via continuous deployment with Travis.
* "manually", from your local machine via the `deploy` script.

Either way, you'll need to set up your deployment server to start.
The steps below are also covered in the CI/CD workshop.

### Heroku

1.  Set up the [Heroku command line tools][heroku-cli]
2.  `heroku login`
3.  Add a git remote for heroku:
